## Description

Twitch Streams is web app which lets you create list of streams and check when whether online.

It is basically Twitch's own "Followed" page, it just loads faster. :)

## Features
- search through Twitch.tv channels
- save channels from found ones
- remove channels from the list
- picked channels are saved on your machine, which means you can come back any time and have your list untouched


## Requirements
- IE10+
- latest Chrome, Firefox, Opera

It will probably not work on stock mobile browsers, especially outdated ones.
